% This Matlab module provides an API for controlling a multi-channel transcranial magnetic stimulation (mTMS) device.
% It includes the functionality to start and stop the device, send pulses, charges, and discharges, and to perform
% various analyses of the EEG/EMG data.
%
% It uses the Robot Operating System (ROS2) to interact with the device.

classdef MTMSApi < handle
    % An API for controlling a multi-channel transcranial magnetic stimulation (mTMS) device.

    properties (Constant)
        % TIME_EPSILON is used to implement events that are to be executed immediately but
        % wanting to synchronize them: to do that, get current time, add TIME_EPSILON to it,
        % and execute all the events at that time.
        %
        % Consequently, TIME_EPSILON must be large enough to allow time to send the events to
        % the mTMS device, but not too large so that the events are not executed 'immediately'.
        %
        % TODO: In MATLAB, 0.1 seconds is too little. In Python, however, 0.1 s works fine.
        %   Settle for 1.5 s for now, but it could be investigated if the code could be optimized
        %   to allow a shorter time interval.
        %
